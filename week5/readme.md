TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Did of alot of trial and error throughout this week. (Almost too much)
Again, what wasnt clear to me was the arranging of math formulaes into python scirpt. Had to use a alot o resourcecs for this. 

For this task again I encountered again the power of resourceful friends and that in turn contributed to the completion of some questions in teh task. 

However, "the def get_a_word_of_length_n(length):" question was difficult in meeting the pre-determined requirements. An issue of >= not valid between str and int was encounted many times, and i still have not idea how to solve this. If the tutors would kindly answer this, it would be much appreciated.
