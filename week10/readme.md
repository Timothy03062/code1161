TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
For this task, I learnt how to direct files to certain paths and activate the pose estimation for the camera using python. What I faild at doing however was getting the code to indicate that a person was calling for a taxi through his or her actions/movements. What my partner and I thouhgt was to either to use camera pixel and sections to judge whether a persons calling for a taxi or using a specific position for then thhe Y for the wrist geos above the Y of the shoulder, but we were unable to solve the issue. We did however know to use the dictionary that was provided ansd utlisie that in solving the problem.

Unfortunately, our coding skills were not sufficient enough. We hope to eventually improve.
