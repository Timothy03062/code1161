TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week's Primary focus is on Panda. My question is whether alcohol will affect global happiness or vice versa. 

What was confusing this week was how to make a graph be beside another on one row. But after some time and stakeflow research, the issue howo solved. 

For next week , I plan to construct a 3D graph for presentation.
