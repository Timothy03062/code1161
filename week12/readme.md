TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week, I finally got the 3D graph working. Yet due to the limitations of BASEMAP, and its 3D function using Mathplotlib, various adjustments had to be made, such as converting the data manually into the correct units. Longtitude and Latitude data of countries also had to be manually inputted (Hardcoded), due to json files (countris.json), sometimes having unmatchable data with basemap coordinational plotting. Once again, as usual, Ananconda and various modules continously crash and/or are unable to be used due to version incompatibilty and specifications, hence limiting the presetation to simple terms rather than express complexity. 

To summarize: computer issues, and my inexperince incoding.
This semester, I learnt many things about coding, from my start of nothing to somewhat something. I will continiously strive to learn (Hopely) new things.
