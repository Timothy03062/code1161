TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Im very unsure of what to do about the laser.pew file generation. Maybe there is a way to do this?
This session I tried to parson some json files. Initally the file was slightly hard for me to translate the information into python code, but through some trial and error i finally got there. 

I learnt this new module called import requests, which can be used to import the requests moduele into the code for usage. This was quite useful for that particulat task and its relation to jsaon files. Athough i wasnt sure in the beginning, but after asing some friends who know python, I figured it out through a painful trial and error which took a long time. 

Also in this week's hw, I lerant about opening files and how to count the frequency of a a particular string.
